  <h1>Bubble Matching Game</h1>
  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Players click on bubbles that contain numbers. If they successfully click on matching numbers, their score increases. The game continues as bubbles with different numbers pop up, allowing the player to keep scoring.</p>
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bubbles:</strong> Each bubble displays a random number.</li>
    <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Players earn points by clicking on two bubbles with the same number.</li>
    <li><strong>Timer:</strong> A timer counts down, and players aim to score as high as possible before time runs out.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Difficulty:</strong> As the game progresses, bubbles appear more quickly, adding a challenge.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
  <p>The game will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Defines the layout with a game area, a score display, and a timer display.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styles the bubbles with animations to make them appear to float. Colors and transitions are used for visual appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Generates bubbles with random numbers at intervals, detects clicks on bubbles, checks if they match, and increases the score if they do. It also manages the timer, ending the game when time runs out.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This project makes for a fun, interactive game and is ideal for practicing JavaScript DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and HTML layout design.</p>
